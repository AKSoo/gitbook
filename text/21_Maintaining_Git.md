# Repository Maintenance 

Git can become slow if very large files or a large number of smaller files are stored. Due to the structure of the Git repositories, and the amount of information stored after each commit, deleting a file does not necessarily delete it from your repository since the file may still exist in the history. Therefore, it is best to set aside some time periodically to perform maintenance on your repositories. 

One option to address large files is to compress them. However, it is best to remove files that are no longer necessary. As mentioned previously, to truly delete a file from your repository you will likely need to modify the history by deleting the file from every commit that contains it. Since small mistakes rewriting Git history can corrupt your version control, it is best to first backup your repository. This involves first cloning your repository and compressing the clone by zipping it. This backup can then be deleted after you have confirmed that the unnecessary files were removed from your repository without corruption. The [git filter-branch](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-filter-branch) command can be used to actually delete the file, and [git reflog](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reflog) can be used to manage the associated history. After the unwanted file is removed from repository history [git gc](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-gc) can be used to remove all data that is not referenced and recompress the archive.
