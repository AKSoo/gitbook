# Welcome to Git

Welcome to Git - the fast, distributed version control system.

This book is meant to be a starting point for people new to Git to learn it 
as quickly and easily as possible.

This book will start out by introducing you to the way Git stores data, to 
give you the context for why it is different than other VCS tools.
This is meant to take you about 20 minutes.

Next we will cover **Basic Git Usage** - the commands you will be using 90% of 
the time.  These should give you a good basis to use Git comfortably for most
of what you're going to use it for.  This section should take you about 30 
minutes to read through.

Next we will go over **Intermediate Git Usage** - things that are slightly more
complex, but may replace some of the basic commands you learned in the first 
section.  This will mostly be tricks and commands that will feel more 
comfortable after you know the basic commands.
