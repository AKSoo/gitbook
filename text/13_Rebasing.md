# Rebasing

Suppose that you create a branch "mywork" on a remote-tracking branch
"origin".

    $ git checkout -b mywork origin

![origin and mywork point to commit C2](../figure/rebase0.png)

Now you do some work, creating two new commits.

    $ vi file.txt
    $ git commit
    $ vi otherfile.txt
    $ git commit
    ...
    
Meanwhile, someone else does some work creating two new commits on the origin
branch too. This means both 'origin' and 'mywork' has advanced, which means 
the work has diverged.

![origin (C4) and mywork (C6) diverge at C2](../figure/rebase1.png)

At this point, you could use "pull" to merge your changes back in;
the result would create a new merge commit, like this:

![git merge creates C7 by combining C4 and C6](../figure/rebase2.png)

However, if you prefer to keep the history in mywork a simple series of
commits without any merges, you may instead choose to use
[git rebase](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase):

    $ git checkout mywork
    $ git rebase origin

This will remove each of your commits from mywork, temporarily saving
them as patches (in a directory named ".git/rebase"), update mywork to
point at the latest version of origin, then apply each of the saved
patches to the new mywork.  

![git rebase applies C5' and C6' to origin (C4)](../figure/rebase3.png)

Once the ref ('mywork') is updated to point to the newly created commit 
objects, your older commits will be abandoned.  They will likely be
removed if you run a pruning garbage collection. (see [git gc](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-gc))

![mywork moves to C6' then C5 and C6 are removed](../figure/rebase4.png)

So now we can look at the difference in our history between running a merge
and running a rebase:

![git rebase results in linear history while git merge diverge and converge](../figure/rebase5.png)

In the process of the rebase, it may discover conflicts.  In that case it will stop
and allow you to fix the conflicts; after fixing conflicts, use "git-add"
to update the index with those contents, and then, instead of
running git-commit, just run

    $ git rebase --continue

and git will continue applying the rest of the patches.

At any point you may use the `--abort` option to abort this process and
return mywork to the state it had before you started the rebase:

    $ git rebase --abort
